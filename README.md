# todolistpostmancollection
Just contains POSTMAN collection json files which can be imported by the people who want to use this to test the web services

1. ToDoAPIs-localhost.postman_collection.json - This file contains the postman collection to ToDoAPIs with localhost endpoints. This is useful if  user has hosted the web application on local machine. 

2. ToDoAPIs-AWS.postman_collection.json- This file contains the postman collection to ToDoAPIs for the ToDoAPIs what I have hosted on AWS. These are accessible to any one on the web. Please do not use actual email ids and passwords.  I don't take any resposibility if some one by mistake ends up using this for storing sensitive information on this app.


3. dotolist.war - This is the actual war file of ToDoList back end which can be downloaded by the users and deployed by user on TomCat 8.5 version. If you want to have a look at the source code of the application then please visit - https://github.com/AnilDeshpande/dotolist


4. ToDoAPIs-localhost.postman_collection_with_updated_Delete.json - This file contains the postman collection to ToDoAPIs with localhost endpoints.
